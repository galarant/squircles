Just a fun little canvas game

## Setup

`$ npm install`

## Development

To run a local dev server on 8000:

`$ npm run dev`

This local server actively watches for file changes and rebuilds your app on the fly.

## Testing

> Before running any tests, you should have your local dev server running first.

To run the full suite of tests:

`$ npm run test`

To run a specific test:

`$ npm run test -- --test tests/path/to/your/test.js`
